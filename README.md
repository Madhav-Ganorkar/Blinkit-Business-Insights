# 🛒 Blinkit Business Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **end-to-end Power BI dashboard** built on Blinkit-style data to help business managers understand **what is happening across sales, customers, delivery, ratings, and inventory** at a glance.

The dashboard is designed in a **management-first approach**:
- **Page 1** → Executive Overview (WHAT is happening)
- **Pages 2–4** → Deep-dive analysis (WHY & WHERE action is needed)

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Track overall business performance
- Identify revenue drivers and declining trends
